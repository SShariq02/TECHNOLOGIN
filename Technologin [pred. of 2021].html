<h2>Worldwide COVID-19</h2>
<p>In the end of 2020, we had another crushal news about coronavirus that, In UK ,A new variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly in England and raising international alarms. This new variant now accounts for more than 60% of the cases in London. And scientists say the variant is likely more contagious than previous versions of the virus.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:250%">PREDICTIONS OF 2021 ABOUT TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;font-size:290%" >1. No Speed Limit on Innovation</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-family:Calisto MT"><img src="innov.jpg" style="float:right;width:400px;height:350px;margin-right:15px;">
Thought developer-first was big? It is just getting started. The world of dev tools, infrastructure and open source software moved faster in 2020, and in 2021 we will only see it accelerate. New projects and categories will gain traction and go mainstream faster than ever before. Bellwether projects that seemed to be gliding along with momentum may become passe. This is a developer’s world now and the speed limits that used to hold back innovation and adoption are gone.</p>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;font-size:290%">2. The Hottest Technology of 2021</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-family:Calisto MT"><img src="tecf.jpg" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;">
Is it too obvious to say “AI” (again)? We may see trillion-parameter pre-trained NLP models in 2021. One of the things we saw in 2020 was a kind of arms race amongst the big tech companies involved in building in extremely large pre-trained NLP models, such as GPT-3, or Microsoft’s Turing, with hundreds of billions of parameters. The capabilities of these systems have surprised even the deep experts in the field.</p>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;font-size:290%">3. 5G Network</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-family:Calisto MT"><img src="5g.jpg" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;">
5G networks are the next big thing in mobile internet connectivity with the speed of 100gbps. After almost a decade of development, it has finally become a reality in some areas. It offers an unprecedented transmission speed that far surpasses its predecessor, 4G. And since we’re talking gigabytes per second transfer rate, 5G is actually faster than virtually any home broadband available.5G can go as much as 100x faster than 4G.</p>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;font-size:290%">4. Virtual Reality</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-family:Calisto MT"><img src="vr.jpg" style="float:right;width:400px;height:200px;margin-right:15px;">
Virtual Reality (VR) immerses the user into an environment. By stimulating their hearing and vision, it makes them feel as if they are experiencing the simulated environment firsthand. The most popular application of Virtual Reality is on gaming, with PlayStation VR and Facebook’s Oculus leading the market in 2021.</p>
<p style="background-color:LightGray;font-size:290%">5. ChatBot</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center;font-family:Calisto MT"><img src="chat.png" style="float:right;width:400px;height:300px;margin-right:15px;">
Due to the growth of machine learning, chatbots have become extremely popular for small businesses and huge enterprises alike. Combine that with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and we got ourselves a more responsive, more intelligent, and more human conversational agent. Typically, chatbots are used in customer service. It will also become one of the most popular SMB technological trends of 2021.</p>
